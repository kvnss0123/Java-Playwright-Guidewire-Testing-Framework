Playwright Automation Framework
This project is a Java-based automation framework built using Playwright for browser automation and testing. It provides utilities for interacting with web elements, managing coverage terms, and performing common web interactions.

Features
Web Interaction Helper: A utility class (WebInteractionHelper) for interacting with web elements, including clicking, typing, selecting dropdowns, handling checkboxes, and more.

Coverage Utilities: A utility class (CoverageUtils) for managing coverage-related interactions, such as adding/removing coverages and setting coverage terms.

Page Object Management: Supports the Page Object Model (POM) design pattern for better test maintenance.

Cross-Browser Support: Leverages Playwright's multi-browser support (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit).

Logging: Integrated logging using Java's java.util.logging for better debugging and traceability.

Prerequisites
Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

Java Development Kit (JDK): Version 11 or higher.

Maven: For dependency management and building the project.

Playwright: Included as a dependency in the pom.xml file.

Setup
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/playwright-automation-framework.git
cd playwright-automation-framework
Install Dependencies:
Run the following command to install all dependencies:

bash
Copy
mvn clean install
Download Playwright Browsers:
Playwright requires browser binaries to run. Install them using the following command:

bash
Copy
mvn exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="com.microsoft.playwright.CLI" -Dexec.args="install"
Configure Logging:
Update the logging.properties file (if needed) to customize logging levels and outputs.

Usage
WebInteractionHelper
The WebInteractionHelper class provides methods for interacting with web elements. Below are some examples:

java
Copy
// Initialize the Playwright page
Page page = playwright.chromium().launch().newPage();

// Create an instance of WebInteractionHelper
WebInteractionHelper helper = new WebInteractionHelper(page);

// Click on an element
helper.click("elementLocator");

// Type text into an input field
helper.type("inputLocator", "Hello, World!");

// Select an option from a dropdown
helper.selectByText("dropdownLocator", "Option 1");

// Check if an element is visible
boolean isVisible = helper.isVisible("elementLocator");
CoverageUtils
The CoverageUtils class provides methods for managing coverage-related interactions. Below are some examples:

java
Copy
// Initialize the Playwright page
Page page = playwright.chromium().launch().newPage();

// Create an instance of CoverageUtils
CoverageUtils coverageUtils = new CoverageUtils(page);

// Add an electable coverage
coverageUtils.addElectableCoverage("Coverage Name");

// Remove an electable coverage
coverageUtils.removeElectableCoverage("Coverage Name");

// Set a coverage term value
coverageUtils.setCoverageTerm("Coverage Name", "Term Name", "Value");
Running Tests
To run tests, use the following Maven command:

bash
Copy
mvn test
